WEB3 project that let users to leave messages to the blockchain.
Users could also be rewarded with ETH if they are lucky! (5% chance)
You need to connect with metamask before leaving a message.

PS. commit history kinda wack because I used repl.it and local repo and merged them in github  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

PS2 There could be a problem with showing older messages, I focused on WEB3, ETH parts in this project so frontend whacky too ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
